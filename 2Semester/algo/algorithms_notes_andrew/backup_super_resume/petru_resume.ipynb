Given a pair (b1 , b2) of bitstrings, we can encode the pair (x,y) as the string x#y over the alphabet {0,1,#}, then encode the ones as 11,the zeros as 00 and the # as 10.\n",

    "    - Taking into account the worst case, which is a list reverse-ordered, the number of instructions is bounded to a quadratic function (n^2) wrt the length of the input. In particular the number of the instruction is of the form b + c · n^2, for suitable constants b, c, and thus it is bounded by a polynomial wrt the length of the input.\n",
