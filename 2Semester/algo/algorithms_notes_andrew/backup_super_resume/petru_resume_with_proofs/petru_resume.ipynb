So in case of 3SAT we have 2^n -1 = 7 nodes per clause. There are other inconsistencies of which we should take care of? Yes: the same variable occurring negated in the assignment into another clause -> there's an inconsistency with these two assignments -> put an edge between them.  \n",
    "Great, so if we the 3SAT problem is composed by n clauses we need simply to convert it in the former descripted graph and solve INDSET with minimum size of the independent graph = n. Once the subset of consistent assignment has been found it's easy to convert it in the assignment of all the variables of the initial formula F of the 3SAT problem.\n",

    "We studied the classes SAT, and 3SAT, and 2SAT. You are required to classify the problem 1SAT containing all (and only) the satisfiable 1CNFs. In particular, to which complexity class does 1SAT belong? Prove your claim.\n",

    "\n",
    "since 1SAT has only one literal per clause, namely it has only AND between N variables, we can just for loop all the variables and for each variable I check whether from the other N-1 variables is not present the same variable negated. Therefore 1SAT is in P.\n",

    "One can test whether a graph G contains a k-vertex clique, and find any such clique that it contains, using a brute force algorithm. This algorithm examines each subgraph with k vertices and checks to see whether it forms a clique. It takes time O(nk k2), as expressed using big O notation. This is because there are O(nk) subgraphs to check, each of which has O(k2) edges whose presence in G needs to be checked. Thus, the problem may be solved in polynomial time whenever k is a fixed constant. However, when k does not have a fixed value, but instead may vary as part of the input to the problem, the time is exponential.\n",

To complete the independent set you need to add also the nodes that are not in edges. If you write a pseudocode for the above algorithm you can check that it runs in polytime on the input size\n",
