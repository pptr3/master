    "See the pdf. The resume is that taken a F= C1^C2^..^Cn where Ci has an arbitrary number of literals, you convert it into 3C1^3C2^..^3Cm where 3Ci has at most 3 literals. To do it you need to \"explode\" each Ci in a group of 3Ci each composed by less literals. But how do you relate these 3Ci literals in order to obtain a formula 3F which is satisfiable iff F is satisfiable? By introducing cleverly some new variables into the 3Ci clauses which inter-relate the 3Ci clauses. (number of new variables= number of C literals -3)\n",

    "Each possible clause assignation, BUT THE ONE which makes the clause NOT SATISFIABLE (ONLY ONE SINCE THE VARIABLES ARE LINKED BY \"OR\" WITHIN A CLAUSE, so the assignment in which all literals are false), are transformed into a node and connected between them by edges (to say that they are mutually exclusive, indeed we use edges to inconsistencies). So in case of 3SAT we have 2^n -1 = 7 nodes per clause. There are other inconsistencies of which we should take care of? Yes: the same variable occurring negated in the assignment into another clause -> there's an inconsistency with these two assignments -> put an edge between them.  \n",
    "Great, so if we the 3SAT problem is composed by n clauses we need simply to convert it in the former descripted graph and solve INDSET with minimum size of the independent graph = n. Once the subset of consistent assignment has been found it's easy to convert it in the assignment of all the variables of the initial formula F of the 3SAT problem.\n",

    "One can test whether a graph G contains a k-vertex clique, and find any such clique that it contains, using a brute force algorithm. This algorithm examines each subgraph with k vertices and checks to see whether it forms a clique. It takes time O(nk k2), as expressed using big O notation. This is because there are O(nk) subgraphs to check, each of which has O(k2) edges whose presence in G needs to be checked. Thus, the problem may be solved in polynomial time whenever k is a fixed constant. However, when k does not have a fixed value, but instead may vary as part of the input to the problem, the time is exponential.\n",

To complete the independent set you need to add also the nodes that are not in edges. If you write a pseudocode for the above algorithm you can check that it runs in polytime on the input size\n",
