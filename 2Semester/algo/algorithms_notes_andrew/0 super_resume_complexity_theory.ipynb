This way indeed we obtain  L={x $\\in$ {0,1}* | |∃ y  $\\in$ {0,1}^0. M(>x,y<)=1} where y is the empty string, so it is equal (with a small encoding difference) to L={x $\\in$ {0,1}* | M(>x<)=1}.\n",

So the algorithm is bounded by 2^p(|x|) * q(|x|) = O( 2^p(|x|) * 2^{log(q(|x|))} ) = O( 2^ {p(|x|) + q(|x|)} = O(2^{p(|x|)+q(|x|)}) which is bounded by 2^{n^c} with c big enough, so it is exponential.\n",

Each branch takes polynomial time since at each step a bit is added, and the length of the certificate is p(|x|) by hypothesis. Only after that, N calls the verifier M in each branch and execute it on the pair input (x,y) WITHOUT NON-DETERMINISM. Of course if M outputs 1 then N halts in qaccept, otherwise it regrets the input x. The overall runtime of N is p(|x|) + q(|x|), where q is the polynomial bounding the M runtime.
