    "Why do we care about such a primitive/low-level computational model?

And why is this important? BECAUSE THE TM GIVES US AN UPPER BOUND OF THE COMP. COST OF A PROCESS. ANYWAY THERE ARE HIGHER LEVEL COMP. COST WHICH ARE MORE USEFUL TO DETERMINE THE COMP. COST OF AN ALGORITHM, THE ONE WHICH IS IMPLICITLY CONSIDERED WHEN TALKING ABOUT THE COMP.

The program finishes when the tape head stops (reaches an HALT STATE) and doesn't have any other instructions.

    "More formally: One can think of the Turing machine as a simpliﬁed modern computer, with the machine’s tape corresponding to a computer’s memory, and the transition function and register corresponding to the computer’s central processing unit (CPU). However, **it is better to think of Turing machines** as a simply formal way to describe algorithms. Even though algorithms are often best described by plain English text, it is sometimes useful to express them by such a formalism in order to argue about them mathematically. Despite the model's simplicity, given any computer algorithm, a Turing Machine capable of simulating that specific algorithm's logic can be constructed. <br> \n",
    "Actually there are many possible definitions of the Turing Machines, **the main distinction** is that some are based on using one single tape, other using k tapes (the case of a single tape is just a case of the more general case). Not that any k is fine, but a TM must have a fixed k, it can't be changed depending on the input. <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "So we define it in the most general way: with k-tapes.\n",
    "\n",
    "A k-tapes M is made up of:\n",
    "- **Scratch Pad/Working space**: the scratch pad consists of k tapes + heads. A tape is an infinite one-directional line of cells, each of which can hold a symbol from a finite set Γ called **the alphabet of the machine** (the alphabet contains 0,1 for sure  and can contain other symbols, for instance to indicate blank cells, start cells.. ). Each tape is equipped with a tape head that can potentially read or write symbols to the tape one cell at the time. The machine’s computation is divided into discrete time steps, and the head can move left or right of one cell at each step. The **first tape** of the machine is designated as the input tape. The machine’s head can only read symbols from that tape and not also write them (a so-called read-only head). The k−1 read-write tapes are called **work tapes** and **the last** one of them is designated as the output tape of the machine, on which it writes its final answer before halting its computation.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Finite set of operations/rules**: the machine has a finite set of states, denoted by Q. The machine contains a “register” that can hold a single element of Q; this is **the ”state” of the machine at that instant**. This state determines its action at the next computational step, which consists of the following: (1) read the symbols in the cells directly under the k heads (2) for the k−1 read/write tapes replacing each symbol with a new symbol (it has the option of not changing the tape by writing down the old symbol again), (3) change its register to contain another state from the finite set Q (it has the option not to change its state by choosing the old state again) and (4) move each head one cell to the left or to the right.\n",

    "**NOTE**: TM do *local computation*, that means that the head can't move from one cell to any other one, but at each step it can move only of one cell.\n",

It means that the transition function is a function which takes as input a state (taken from Q) and a k symbols from alpha (which are the symbols read from the k tapes in the cells in which the tape heads are in that moment), and outputs a new state (taken from Q), and a symbol for each k tapes (but the input tape), and also outputs a possible head tape movement for each of the k tapes, which could be left, stay or right. <br> This function simply means: given the state q and the symbols in the k tapes then update the state, update the symbols in the k-1 tapes (the input tape is only reading) and move each tape head on the Right, on the Left or Stay there. More formally all this can be said in this way: If the machine is in state q ∈ Q and (σ1,σ2,...,σk) are the symbols currently being read in the k tapes, and δ(q,(σ1,...,σk+1)) = (q0,(σ0 2,...,σ0 k),z) where z ∈{L,SR}k then at the next step the σ symbols in the last k−1 tapes will be replaced by the σ0 symbols, the machine will be in state q0, and the k+1 heads will move Left, Right or Stay in place, as given by z. (If the machine tries to move left from the leftmost position of a tape then it will stay in place.) \n",
