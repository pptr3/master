    "-  Suppose you have done unification with the head of this fresh variant:  p(X1):- q(Z1),r(Z1). So the new goals now are q(Z1),r(Z1). Now suppose you have the fact q(a) in your KB. then you do the substitution Z1/a to unify q(Z1). Now the next goal is r(Z1) or r(a)? It's r(a)!! because q and r come from the same clause and have exactly the same name of variable, so the substitution applied to q(Z1) changes also r(Z1)!.\n",
    "- When you backtrack remember to backtrack also the substitutions!!!!\n",
    "- Once you unify with a a rule and its body (substituted) becames the new goal, you must alway start again from the top-most formula to try unifing it!) \n",
    "- If the goal is q(Z1),r(Z1). q(Z1) is taken first because the left-most. Suppose it unifies with q(a). NOW THIS IS REALLY IMPORTANT: THE QUERY r(Z1) has the same variable so it is substitued too!!! SO THE NEW GOAL NOW IS r(a).\n",
