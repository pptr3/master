    "- the set of formulas which represent the considered world/state are called \"KB\" or \"program\", indeed in declarative programming to write a program means to write this set of formulas. Then to ask a query (which is simply a formula), and the interpreter will find the solution!! It does it thanks to synctactic methods resolution-like. Especially important is the \"unification\". There are many choices points about which formula to unify with the query; prolog uses a strategy called \"SLD Resolution\" = first is considered the left-most query and the top-most formula\". See more details on the next example.\n",
    "- \",\" stays for end.   Each formula must finish with \".\"\n",
    "- rules: H:- B1,B2..Bn. (it can be n=1)\n",
    "- facts: F.\n",
    "- constants start with lower case. a, x..\n",
    "- variables start with upper case. A, X..\n",
    "- implicitly when you write the query, it is interpreted like this:   KB |- query.  So the interpreter in prolog uses resolution-like methods to check if the derivation is true. If it is, it also outputs the substitutions done of the variables appearing in the query.\n",
    "- \"_\" is the anonimous variable, which simply means that the substitution done to unify a variable with it is not stored. If in the formula a variable appears only once, it can be replaced by an anonimus variable to save memory. \n",
    "- prolog backtracks not only when it fails a derivation, but also when it succeeds! So it can gives you back more than one answer/possible substitution of the query variables.\n",
    "- in the examples i write the substitution of each step, then when the derivation is finished i look for all the substitution applied to the variables of the query. Actually prolog each time has a new substitution applies it to the old one and store the result.\n",
    "- The use of \"or\", \"not\" is not discussed in LP. You must use only \"<-\" (\":-\" in prolog) and \"and\"(\",\" in prolog). For example if you want to write p(X):- p(a) V p(b) you must write this:  p(X):-p(a) and in another line this  p(X):-p(b). For as regars the \"not\" there's a built in predicate called \"not\".

    "it takes the query and tries to unify it with the top-most formula, if the formula is a rule (so of the form H:-B), the unification is done only with the H. To be more precise the query must be unified wih a FRESH VARIANT of the FORMULA (not only H). The fresh variant is the formula with renaiming of all the variables with names which are not in the rest of the KB or in the query. Then if the query unifies with the Head of the rule, the Body, after applying the substitution which did the unification, is added to the left of the queries. If the unification was done with a fact then nothing is added to the queries. If the unification is not possible you try the same thing with the second formula of the KB and so on. If none of the formulas of the KB unifies with the query you must backtrack to the previous choice point (for example if you unified the initial query with the first formula, but then with the new goal you can't do any unification -> you must backtrack to the unification of the initial query and instead of unify it with the top-most formula, try with the second, and so on). If the query gets stack into a loop because of infinite substitutions, then prolog doesn't five you an answer, it gets stuck or raises an error.\n",

    "1)So now the new goal is (p(X2,Y2,Z2))sigma = p(b,Y2,Z1).\n",
    "\n",
    "p(b,Y2,Z1) is tried to be unified with the fresh variant of the top most formula head: p(a,X3,Z3) but it fails.\n",
    "Also with the second formula. It unifies instead with the head of p(b,c,Z3):-q(Z3),r(Z3), thanks to this mgu: sigma={Y2/c,Z3/Z1}.\n",
    "\n",
    "2)So the new goal is q(Z1),r(Z1).  q(Z1) is taken first because the left-most. It can only unify with the fact q(f(W)), thanks to this mgu: sigma={Z1/f(W)}.  NOW THIS IS REALLY IMPORTANT: THE QUERY r(Z1) has the same variable so it is substitued too!!!\n",
    "\n",
    "3)So the new goal is r(f(W)). It gives us a fail because it can't be unified with any formula of the KB (note that r(f(W) and r(a) can't unify because the substitutin must be something like {variable-> term}). SO IT BACKTRACKS TO THE LAST CHOICE POINT. Is the 2) step the choice point? No because we had no choice, q(Z1) could only unify with a formula. Is the 1) step the choice point? No again because we see that p(b,Y2,Z1) could only unify with the third formula. Is the 0) step the choice point? yes, because we unify the query with the top-most formula, but we can do it also with the second, which is what we must try now:\n",

    "0.back) p(X1,b,Z1) is unified with the head of the second formula fresh variant: p(a,b,Z2):-p(a,b,Z2). thanks to the substitution sigma={X1/a,Z2/Z1}. So the new goal is p(a,b,Z1).\n",
    "\n",
    "1.back) p(a,b,Z1) can unify with the head of the first formula fresh variant: p(a,X2,Z2):-p(X2,Y2,Z2) thnks to the substitution sigma={X2/a,Y2/b,Z2/Z1}. So the new goal is p(a,b,Z1). Which is exactly the starting query of this step. So we're in a loop. So prolog raises an error (or worse doesn't give an ansewr and computes until stopped). "

Also remember that in prolog you don't have \"outputs of functions\". The only output you have is the substitution done to the variables of your query. So you must always put a variable in which to store the result thanks to unification in the predicate.
