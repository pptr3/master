You know that G' is always in CNF, so you can consider it as G' = AandG where A is an atomic goal. So you can say that the initial state is <A^G,T>. Suppose you have the rule H<-B in your KB. The unfold rule says that if you can unify (A,H)sigma then instead of the atom A you can satisfy B, so the new state is <B^G,sigma> because you must keep track of the substitutions done. To be more general if you are not considering the initial state, but for instance you're considering to apply unfold to a state which has already substitutions, like <B^G,sigma>, you must consider also those. You also have to consider that if you apply the substitution you risk to change all the variables of the program with the names involved in that substitution; to avoid that when you consider a clause rename the variables with new names.

Note that the problem is seen as if the root node is the initial state <G,no_subs> and the leaves are the final states, which can be failure or succesful. Each path is a derivation.
